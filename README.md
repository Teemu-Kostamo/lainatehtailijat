The user can browse and search for loanable works. He can see for each work whether the work is on loan or not. You can return your borrowed works. Each work can have one or more authors, name and year of publication. Naturally, one author can be behind several works. The borrowing period can be specified in advance, e.g. 2 weeks. The loan period and the last return time are determined automatically.

The maintenance user interface should easily reveal which works each user has on loan. Is there possibility to attach tags and images (e.g. cover photo) to borrowed items?
